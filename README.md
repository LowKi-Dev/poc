## Proof of Concept: No Code Tool for Solana Programs

This is a proof of concept demonstrating how our Lowki Dev will generate React components from a Solana program's IDL file.

### Instructions to Run the Proof of Concept

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone repo_url
   ```

2. **Install package depedencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Script**

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

4. **Output**

   The script will output a React component to the console, representing a form for the `createBounty` instruction defined in the sample IDL.

### Note

- This is a proof of concept intended to demonstrate the basic functionality of the No Code tool.
- The generated component is a simplified example and may require additional context to run within a full React or Next.js application.

## Roadmap of Features

### Phase 1: Core Functionality

- **Instruction Parsing**
  - Parse Solana program IDL files to extract instruction definitions.
  - Support for various argument types (strings, numbers, public keys, etc.).

- **Component Generation**
  - Generate React components for each instruction, including forms and buttons as appropriate.
  - Use templating to customize component code generation.

- **Integration with Next.js**
  - Automatically create pages within a Next.js project for each generated component.
  - Ensure routing and navigation are set up correctly.

- **CLI Tools**
  - Develop a command-line interface for ease of generation.

- **Wallet Integration**
  - Integrate wallet providers like Phantom or Solflare for authenticating and signing transactions.
  - Provide a seamless user experience for connecting wallets.

### Phase 2: Enhanced User Experience

- **Error Handling**
  - Enhance error handling in generated components to provide meaningful feedback for failed transactions or invalid inputs.

- **Styling and UI Components**
  - Integrate with UI libraries like Material-UI for consistent and modern design.
  - Allow users to customize the look and feel of generated components.

- **Support for Complex Instruction Types**
  - Handle more complex Solana instructions, including those involving program-derived addresses (PDAs) and custom account structures.

- **Security Enhancements**
  - Implement best practices for secure handling of keys and transactions.
  - Ensure compliance with Solana's security guidelines.

### Phase 3: Scalability and Extensibility

- **Plug-in System**
  - Allow developers to add custom templates or modify existing ones.
  - Support for additional front-end frameworks beyond React and Next.js.

- **Documentation and Community Support**
  - Provide comprehensive documentation and tutorials.
  - Foster a community around the tool for collaboration and support.

By following this roadmap, we aim to deliver a comprehensive No Code tool that significantly simplifies the development of web applications interacting with Solana smart contracts.
